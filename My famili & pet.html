        <p>To begin with, my father proudly identifies as a native of Pahang, an area that carries relevance in his life's story. My mother, 
          on the other hand, is a native of the dynamic metropolis of Kuala Lumpur, and she brings a broad background to our family tapestry. 
          In the fortunate year of 2000, the merging of these two dissimilar origins resulted in the pure tie of marriage. As they began their journey together, 
          a celebration of love and devotion blossomed. The next chapter in our family's story witnessed the arrival of my elder brother in July of the following year. 
          This joyous added a new depth to our family dynamic, strengthening the bonds that unite us. The unique basis upon which our familial tale continues 
          to develop is the convergence of Pahang ancestry, the urban spirit of Kuala Lumpur, and the shared experiences of a growing family.</p>

                our residential community club. In that position, she made a substantial contribution to the well-being and unity of our neighbourhood.
