        <h3>COOKING</h3>
    
        <br>
        <p>
            My strong desire in eating has brought me to the point where I am capable of preparing a wide variety of dishes based on my fancies and choices. 
            I typically prepare meals for my brother in the absence of our parents. The majority recipe and knowledge I got it from my mother's, who has generously 
            shared her treasured recipes with me. Furthermore, I have broadened my cooking skills by studying numerous cooking techniques and recipes available on 
            internet platforms such as YouTube. So the dish that I have been cooked is:

                <strong>Aglio Olio Dumpling</strong><br><br>
                My passion into Western food began with the creation and consumption of aglio olio, a typical Italian dish. This delightful meal, simple yet flavorful, 
                represented my initial venture into the wide and savory realm of Western delights. The harmonic blend of olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes turns 
                out a bit salty but still edible.

                <strong>Ayam bakar</strong><br><br>
                   The easiet dish i have cooked. You just need to marinate the chicken with some sauces and herbs overnight to make it more delicious. As the chicken rests overnight, the marinade, which contains a mix of savoury, sweet, and herbaceous aromas, does its magic, infusing and permeating every fibre of the flesh.
                   Following that just grilled the chicken in the oven.

                   This meal is a food masterpiece that holds a special place in my heart because the recipe was passed down entirely from my mother. Every ingredient and process detail represents my mother's experience and competence.  This meal, made with love and tradition, is the essence of my cooking legacy . I could eat this dished everyday !

        <h3>MAKEUP</h3>

        <br>
        <p>
            Recognizing that makeup is a fundamental talent that everyone can do and learn. Yet, I'd want to share my appreciation for my own ability. I take satisfaction in assisting individuals around me to improve their beauty. It makes me happy that my family, friends, cousins, and even my neighbor entrust me with grooming them for important events or festivities. This frequent request demonstrates their trust in my makeup skills. Furthermore, I've spent time honing my talents by experimenting with numerous makeup styles, with the goal of furthering my knowledge in this field.
        </p>

            The first image shows me doing makeup for Maisarah, who is my friend and my roommate on her special day, while the second image shows the makeup application processes for Maisarah. The final shot shows me beautifying my neighbor, who had asked for my help with a wedding ceremony. Unfortunately, due to time restrictions and a rush, there is no picture proof of me doing makeup for my aunt. The makeup look that I have been trying to do is Natural, Arabic, Douyin, Bollywood, and Strawberry makeup look.
